      <h2 class="head">"BEING AN EMPLOYEE I NEVER HAD" ~ ASHWINI</h2>
 <H2 class="head">AREAS OF INTEREST</H2>
  <section >
    <il>
 <h2>Enterpreneurship</h2>
 <p>Although I studied engineering, I eventually realized that a degree was not 
    <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more" >worth anything.
    That is when I recognized that other students were struggling with the same issue. 
    They were earning degrees, but those degrees were not helping them get jobs. 
    Having been an engineer all my life, I wanted to engineer a solution.
    At that time I hearer about NeoG Camp and I am joined without wasting my time.

    function myFunction() {
      var dots = document.getElementById("dots");
      var moreText = document.getElementById("more");
      var btnText = document.getElementById("myBtn");
    
      if (dots.style.display === "none") {
        dots.style.display = "inline";
        btnText.innerHTML = "Read more"; 
        moreText.style.display = "none";
      } else {
        dots.style.display = "none";
        btnText.innerHTML = "Read less"; 
        moreText.style.display = "inline";
      }
    }
    </script>
     <h2>Mentorship</h2>
     <p>
        When I was in college, I had no one to guide
        <span id="dot">...</span> <span id="more line">me on what to do.
        I did not have any mentorship myself. 
        Soon, I released that there is no direction and
        guidance that helps students choose the right career path.
        There is no one to help the students tap into the knowledge 
        of those with more experience than themselves.Then I am start my career 
        with neoG camp. </span>
